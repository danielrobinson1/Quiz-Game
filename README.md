Quiz Game
=========
Project website: http://danielmarkrobinson.netne.net/

A simple quiz game using HTML5 and Javascript. 
The player controls the blue ball by moving the mouse and must collect 20 yellow balls to unlock a question.
Answering a question correctly scores 1 point and a 10 second increase in time.
Collecting a red ball reduces the count of yellows already collected by one.
The game ends either when the timer reaches zero or if a red ball is collected whilst having zero yellow balls.

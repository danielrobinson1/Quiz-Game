Changes from Version 14

- Added code to function player1.handleMouseMovement() to deal with Firefox's inability process offsetX. In this case we use layerX instead.
  Due to the subtle diffenrence between offsetX and layerX we added an extra parent div "canvasContainer" containing the "gameCanvas" and "questionContainer" divs.
  This also ensures that the top of the question container appears halfway down the canvas in all browsers. Before this it was appearing halfway down the Div
  "container" instead, in some browsers.



To Do
- Choose better font for the canvas text. Can we set up the code so that we only have to change this in one place rather than editing for example the startscreen font, score and timer display etc invidually?
- Maybe instead of ending the game when collected gets to zero, maybe remove a point from score or, decrease the timer. It's quite easy 
  to collect a red first when the speed is increased.
- Have final 10 seconds coundown in centre of screen in large font.
- Have colour of player1 change as more yellow are collected. Colour gets stronger the closer to the target collected.
- Create a mystery enemy, which if collected could for example speed up the game, or switch the colours of the enemies or something.
  Mystery enemy could rapidly change colours every quarter second or so.
- Download and introduce jquery. For example in jquery $("game Canvas") is used instead of document.getElementById("gameCanvas") - Tidier code.
- Could add a question: What is the current Time? And add the current time dynamically as the answer. Couldn't quite figure out how to implement this.
	- Need to write a function to display the current time (http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_datetime).
	- Want to get rid of the questionList[31] = currentTime. If we addd new questions later, the reference to entry 31 may not be correct.
- Clearing of screen after question is hidden seems a bit jerky.
- Could use different humourous comments, chosen at random, when a question is answered, instead of just 'correct' or 'incorrect'. 
- When a question is answered correct just add 10 seconds rather than resetting to the initial value.
- Canvas dimensions are currently set at 800px by 400px. 
  Would be nice to set up so that if we alter this later, then resizing of all necessary child elements is taken care of.
  Also if I set dimensions of canvas in CSS #gameCanvas {height: 400px; width: 800px;}, all images and text appear stretched.
- Debug all CSS sizing properties.
- See if a 'constructor/prototype' (not sure of the correct term), can be used to create new questions, instead of an array, and is it more convenient?


BUGS

-In FF (and IE) the cursor icon appears in a corner of the canvas on game start. 


Browser Issues

- Firefox: Movement of player1 is not paired with mouse movement. Problem with addEventListener("mousemove", , )?
